[Using Clean Architecture for Microservice APIs in Node.js with MongoDB and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnailTcJV_U)

> In this video we talk about Bob Martin's Clean Architecture model and I will show you how we can apply it to a Microservice built in node.js with MongoDB and Express JS - @arcdev1

## Running Locally

#### Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com) (To use the Mongo DB interface as shown in the Mastery Monday youtube video, you need to install Mongo Compass)
* [Azure Content Moderator account (free)](https://contentmoderator.cognitive.microsoft.com)
* [Akismet Developer account (free)](https://akismet.com/development/api/#getting-started)


#### 1. Clone the repo and install dependencies
```bash
git clone 
cd comments-api
npm i
```

#### 2. Modify the .env file
Save `sampledotenv` as `.env` and then add your database and Content Moderator + Akismet API details.

#### 3. Startup your MongoDB
Usually this is just: `mongod` on the command line.

#### 4. Start the server
To run in production mode where code is transpiled by Babel into a `dist` folder and run directly in `node`:
```bash
npm start
```

To run in development mode where code is run by [babel-node](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-node) via [nodemon](https://nodemon.io) and re-transpiled any time there is a change:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 5. Optional: Dependency Visualization

The dependency visualization is done with [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser).
To generate the graph run:
```bash
npm run depvis
```

The file will then be generated in the root folder as `dep-graph.svg`:
![dependency visualization of the comments api](./dep-graph.svg)
